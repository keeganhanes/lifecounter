# Life Counter
**Stories:**

- As a user, when I launch the application, it should show me four “players”. Each “player” should have a label for their life total, and four pushbuttons (“+”, “-“,”+5”,”-5”).
- As a user, when I push the “+” pushbutton for player 1, it should increment player 1’s life total by 1. “-“ should reduce the life total by 1, “+5” should increment by 5, and “-5” should decrement by 5.
- As a user, when a player's life total drops to 0 or less, it should display a label at the bottom of the app saying "Player X LOSES!"
- As a user, when I rotate the device (landscape to portrait mode or vice versa), it should resize itself evenly.
- As a user, when I run the app on different devices, it should seem "equally balanced" on each device, regardless of orientation. Players' life total labels should be proportional, buttons proportional, and so on.
